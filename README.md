### Personal Information

- **Name: Yonela Mazele**
- **Date: 06/03/2024**
- **Current Role/Position:Student**
- **Field of Interest: Full-stack Developer**

### Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection

1. **Skills Analysis**:
    
    - I am more confident on creating a HTML document and javascript
    - CSS I find it quite challenging, especially the grid layout. On my SDF06 project, I couldn't do the Instagram layout as wanted or envisioned. Took weeks to get the project done. In more depth I don't know what sections or classes I need to target to get the look I want.
    - 
2. **Interests and Values**:
    
    - I'm more interested on the back-end development
    - Learning a server-side language, then practise by creating basic applications that interact with a database.
    - Happy at work means, not being micromanaged, worplace with a human element. Respected and valued. 

### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
    - Role: Back-end Developer
    - Industries: ecommerce, banking and finance, healthcare, advertising, and science and technology industries.
    - Back-end developers are the experts who build and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions on websites. Unlike front-end developers, who control everything you can see on a website, back-end developers are involved in data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see. I am not really interested and rather not creative to be a front-end developer, seeing that CSS is not my strong point.
    
2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:

    - I am a reserved, shy and someone that likes to spend time alone or small groups, not much of a creative. Just likes to solve problems. Being a back-end developer i need to know the back-end language, such as javascript which I think is my strong point or rather I am more confortable with tha CSS. Back-end development, I think it aligns more to the type of person I am. 

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    
    - Need to explose myself to full-stack developement, so I can figure out what are exactly my strong point and weak points. What do I love more and once that is discovered I focus soley on what I am good at. So 1-2 years full-stack development.
      
2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
   Soley focus on what I am good at and just work on that, which would probably be back-end development.

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
    - Need to get much information as I can. Work more on projects that require HTML, CSS and Javascript.
    - Scrimba is a platform I am very much comfortable in and learn alot aesier as I follow along. Watch Youtube videos for better understanding.

2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
    - Get a job as a back-end developer, understand the real work that goes into being a back-end developer and equip myself. 
    - Proficient in version control systems such as GitLab, Git, and GitHub. A backend developer needs to have in-depth knowledge of Java, Python, and PHP. They are the most-used technologies of the current era. So, you should have java backend developer skills and others too.

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
   
    - High Complexity: Backend development can be complex, involving databases, server-side scripting, APIs, and more: I have to always remeber to breath and take breaks when faced with a challeng. Always ask for help if I'm stuck for over 30mins on something. 
- Rapid Technological Changes: I need to be informed of what's goin on and what's new in the world of Technology.
- Pressure for Scalability and Performance: The pressure that will come with perfomanace, I should always refraim from trying to compare myslef with another developer. Always have a positive mindset not comparison. 
- Communication Challenges: Always ask for help and know how to communicate with fellow developers.

3. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    
    - Stay curious and open-minded about new coding languages, technologies, and industry changes.
    - Build a brand, that allows me to be recognised for my skills, knowledge, and contributions.
    - Tech events often attract recruiters and employers looking for talent. Being present and engaged increases my chances of being noticed and considered for job openings.
